# Moving away from big tech, or how I learned to stop worrying and become self reliant:

## Google
  ### Google Drive
  - Self host Owncloud RaspberryPi box
  ### GMail
  - Proton?
  - Self hosted mail server -> Lots more effort
  ### Youtube
  - Honestly the best thing I can think of is just using it on desktop devices. No real alternative as it stands
  ### Chrome
  - Firefox -> Open source, non-profit org

## Meta
  ### WhatsApp
  - Apple iMessage -> Good once I'm back in the UK for people who don't have Signal,not great that it's Apple but better than Meta
  - Signal -> Great service, hard to get people to leave WhatsApp

## Spotify
  - Bandcamp -> good for discovery
  - Physical media -> record shops also good for discovery
  - CD drive for ripping
  - IPod / DAP

## Microsoft
  ### Github
  - GitLab -> Opensource repo management, free private repos
